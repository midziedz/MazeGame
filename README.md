## MazeGame

This is my early project of a maze game, featuring two players (a single-player version was made as well), low-intelligence enemies, TNT for destroying walls and water buckets for eliminating enemies (supposed to be flames, thus the orange colour of their "characters"). It was designed before I thought up a way to render a realistic circle, so octagons are used as circles instead.
